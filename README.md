# Zorin OS Setup by Gabriel Scaranello

This is my Zorin OS installation setup. 😍

This guide translates my personal installation, with packages that I use in my daily life. Use as an example, never as an absolute truth! 😉

> [!NOTE]
> All scripts and configurations have been tested on [Zorin OS 17.3 Core](https://zorin.com/os).  
> Even though it should work on other versions or other distros, it is not guaranteed that it will work.
